# CAPM-Calculator
Executable python app to calculate CAPM

the executable Python app creates a simple GUI to calculate the expected return using the CAPM formula. The user inputs the risk-free rate, the asset’s beta, and the expected market return, and the program calculates the expected return.
Explanation of the Program:
•	The program prompts the user to input the risk-free rate, asset beta, and market return.
•	Upon clicking "Calculate CAPM," the program computes the expected return using the CAPM formula and displays the result as a percentage.
•	The program can be expanded on more to include live market data from various APIs to automatically include the risk free rate and calculate the beta of the specific stock investment and the expected market return (once expanded the user will just need to enter the ticker symbol and the program can output the expected return)
Application of the CAPM Calculator
The CAPM calculator can be used by investors to evaluate the expected return on various assets based on their individual risk profiles. It helps in making more informed investment decisions by quantifying the trade-off between risk and return.
